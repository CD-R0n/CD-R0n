*Trained junior front-end developer with back-end affinity currently open to work*

Since a young age, I've been fascinated by how electronics and computers work.  
After studying automation electronics, I've always worked in that field until I had a unique opportunity to start my own business.  
Ultimately, this didn't work out as I had hoped.  
Therefore, I am now seeking a position where I can build a serious career.  
I've decided to enter the IT field because I've always had a strong affinity for it and because there is a lot of future potential in it.   
I find coding very enjoyable, and I have a good understanding of how computers work and "think".

I am flexible and see myself continuing to learn in order to delve deeper into the world of IT.
