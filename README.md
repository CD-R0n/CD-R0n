Trained Junior Front-End Developer with Back-End Affinity 
=========================================================
 
I have been fascinated by how electronics and computers work since a young age.  
After studying automation electronics, I worked in that field until I had the unique opportunity to start my own business.  
Although this venture did not meet my expectations, it gave me valuable experience and insight.  
 
I am now seeking a position where I can build a serious career.  
To prepare for this, I recently completed a front-end developer training program to open up opportunities in the IT world.  
Programming syntax comes naturally to me, and I have a strong understanding of how computers and systems operate and "think".  
 
I am flexible and committed to continuous learning to grow my career.
